 <center> <b> The Kobe 8 was released to the public in December 2012 </b> as Kobe himself began wearing it on the court. Perhaps inspired by his new basketball trainer, the masterful player went on a magnificent run of point-scoring throughout the month that gave a huge boost to its release.  <br> <br> 
This not only reflects the player’s desire for constant improvement in his own game, but it also makes them relevant for the modern era so that the NBA’s top players can continue to wear them on court.  </body>
